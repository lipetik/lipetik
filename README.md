### Hi there ðŸ‘‹
Hi , I'm Filipe from Brazil , I'm a college student finishing my major in physics at UFES and I have a lot of interest on computational physics. For the last 3 years I have been focusing mainly on doing simulations with the  Quantum Espresso package to study 2D materials properties and it's possible applications. Currently , I'm studying python and trying to improve on it.
